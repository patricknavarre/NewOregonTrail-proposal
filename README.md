# NewOregonTrail-proposal

As a young lad in grade school I always enjoyed computer lab time, because that meant the possibility of playing OREGON TRAIL!!!  What a thrill it was to make it across rivers and carry my family all the way across the country to a new world...without getting dysentery and dying...

I want to recreate this adventure but with a new modern twist to it.  Instead of crossing rivers, you would end up in the wrong part of town...etc.  Nothing NSFW but still adventurous.  

The user would choose one of two...maybe more characters.  The characters have similar difficulty levels, but would give the user a reason to return to the game.  

My stretch goals would be to add animations so the user would get feedback to what is happening.
